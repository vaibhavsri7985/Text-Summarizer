The ball goes skyward off the toe end, and descends towards long off. Shaheen Afridi positions himself and judges the ball's trajectory to perfection.

A very valuable strike from Dube and that brings up the 50-run partnership between Shivam Dube and Tilak Varma! Off just 36 deliveries!

A steely half century from him. Came into the furnace under extreme pressure, but has held up pretty well with calm in his nerves. On a fractionally fuller length, spinning into the batter, Tilak Varma gets down on his knee and sweeps it wide of short fine leg to his right for a single.

The ball flies over the keeper's head and lands in front of Haris Rauf, who charges to his left from short fine leg. The batters complete a single, and Haris throws it wayward towards the bowler's end. Tilak is keen to get the second but Dube has his back against his partner.

India have strengthened their batting for this game, so there is depth to follow, but they need to keep up with the required run rate. Pakistan, though, will be disappointed with the dropped chance of Samson, but overall have given a good account of themselves with the ball so far.
