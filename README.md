![Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c86d6e3-3081-4dfd-b397-6b51819e307c)

An AI-powered text summarizer built with LangChain, HuggingFace LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Streamlit.  
The app can scrape articles from the web, split them into context-aware chunks, and generate exactly three concise summaries using advanced LLMs.

**🚀 Features**  
- 🔗 Input any article URL.  
- 📥 Scrapes content directly from the webpage.  
- ✂️ Splits text into context-preserving chunks (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter).  
- 🤖 Summarizes text with HuggingFace LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct.  
- 📝 Produces three structured summaries (each in one sentence).  
- 🌐 Easy-to-use Streamlit UI.

**📂 Project Workflow**  
1. ⚙️ Load environment variables from .env (HuggingFace token).  
2. 🧠 Initialize HuggingFace model (LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct).  
3. 🌍 Scrape article via UnstructuredURLLoader.  
4. ✂️ Split into chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.  
5. 🔄 Apply two-stage summarization:  
   - Map step: Summarizes individual chunks.  
   - Reduce step: Combines chunk summaries into final 3-sentence output.  
6. 🖥️ Display results in a neat Streamlit UI.

**📊 Example Output**  
- Summary 1: India secured a historic victory in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan.  
- Summary 2: Star performers contributed significantly to India’s success under pressure.  
- Summary 3: The win boosts India’s confidence ahead of upcoming tournaments.

**📓 Notebook (Text_Summarizer.ipynb)**  
Features:  
- 🧩 Demonstrates integration of LangChain with HuggingFace.  
- ✂️ Splits documents into overlapping chunks for better summarization.  
- 🔄 Implements a map-reduce summarization chain.  
- 📦 Returns structured JSON containing 3 key summaries.  

How It Works:  
1. 📚 Import required libraries: langchain, dotenv, huggingface, etc.  
2. 📝 Define a prompt template to ensure exactly 3 summaries.  
3. 🌐 Load content from the target webpage.  
4. ⚡ Process the content with the map-reduce summarization chain.  
5. 📊 Display the final structured summaries.

**🌐 Streamlit App (app.py)**  
Features:  
- 🎨 Clean and user-friendly UI built with Streamlit.  
- ⏳ Shows progress indicators (st.spinner) while loading and summarizing.  
- ✅ Validates input URLs.  
- 🔄 Uses the same summarization chain as the notebook.  
- 📌 Displays the final 3-sentence summary in bullet points.  

How It Works:  
1. 🖊️ Input: User enters a news/blog URL in a text box.  
2. ⚙️ Processing: The app scrapes content, splits it into chunks, and summarizes each chunk.  
3. 📢 Output: Final structured 3-sentence summary is displayed on the UI.
